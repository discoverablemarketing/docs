## API Keys

All ChatAds API requests require authentication via an API key passed in the `x-api-key` header.

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: cak_your_api_key_here" \
  https://chatads--chatads-api-fastapiserver-serve.modal.run/v1/chatads/messages
```

## Getting Your API Key

1. Log into [app.getchatads.com](https://app.getchatads.com)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Give your key a descriptive name
5. Copy the key (starts with `cak_`)

<Warning>
  API keys are shown only once. Store them securely immediately after creation.
</Warning>

## API Key Format

ChatAds API keys follow this format:

```
cak_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

- Prefix: `cak_` (ChatAds Key)
- 32 random characters

    Keep API keys server-side only. Never include them in browser JavaScript, mobile apps, or public repositories.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use environment variables" icon="terminal">
    Store API keys in environment variables, not hardcoded in source code.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rotate keys regularly" icon="rotate">
    Create new keys periodically and revoke old ones.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use separate keys per environment" icon="layer-group">

## Managing API Keys

### Revoking Keys

To revoke an API key:
1. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Find the key you want to revoke
3. Click **Revoke**

<Warning>
  Revoked keys immediately stop working. Make sure to update your applications before revoking a key.
</Warning>

## Team API Keys

API keys belong to your team, not individual users. All team members with appropriate permissions can:
- Create new API keys
- View existing keys (masked)
- Revoke keys

Rate limits are shared across all API keys for a team.
