## Overview

ChatAds uses rate limiting to ensure fair usage and service stability. Limits are applied per team and shared across all API keys.

## Rate Limit Tiers

| Plan | Monthly Requests | Daily Requests |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| Free | 100 | 10 |
| Starter | 5,000 | 500 |
| Pro | 50,000 | 5,000 |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

## Rate Limit Headers

Each response includes rate limit information in the `meta.usage` object:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "usage": {
      "monthly_requests": 250,
      "daily_requests": 20,
      "daily_limit": 100,
      "is_free_tier": true,
      "free_tier_limit": 100,
      "free_tier_remaining": 0
    }
  }
}
```

## Rate Limit Errors

When you exceed your rate limits, you'll receive a `429` error:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
    "message": "Daily request limit exceeded. You've used 120 of 100 requests for today.",
    "details": {
      "daily_limit": 100,
      "daily_usage": 120,
      "reset_at": "2024-01-02T00:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```
