<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="What is ChatAds?">
ChatAds is an API that inserts relevant affiliate links into AI chatbot responses. When users ask about products (like "What's a good yoga mat?"), ChatAds analyzes the message, identifies product keywords, and returns affiliate links you can include in your AI's response.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does ChatAds work?">
ChatAds uses a three-stage pipeline:

1. **Keyword Extraction** - NLP and/or LLM models identify product mentions in messages
2. **Intent Scoring** - Each query receives a purchase intent score (0.0-1.0) to filter low-quality matches
3. **Affiliate Resolution** - Product keywords are matched to affiliate links via Amazon PA-API and Google Shopping

The API returns structured data including the product name, affiliate link, marketing message, and category.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What platforms does ChatAds support?">
ChatAds works with any platform that can make HTTP requests:

- **AI Chatbots** - Claude, GPT, Gemini, custom LLMs
- **Chat Applications** - Customer support bots, product assistants
- **Workflow Tools** - n8n, Zapier, Make
- **Frameworks** - Next.js, Express, FastAPI, Flask, Django
- **MCP Servers** - Claude Desktop, custom MCP implementations
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What affiliate networks does ChatAds use?">
ChatAds currently supports:

- **Amazon Associates** - Via Amazon Product Advertising API (PA-API)
- **Google Shopping** - Via Serper API fallback

When Amazon PA-API doesn't find a match, ChatAds falls back to Google Shopping results (unless you set `fill_priority: "speed"`).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why does ChatAds return only one winning ad?">
To avoid overwhelming users with too many affiliate links, ChatAds returns only the single best-matching ad per request. This keeps the user experience clean and maximizes conversion rates.

If you need multiple ads per request, contact support@getchatads.com to discuss enterprise options.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does ChatAds determine the winning ad?">
ChatAds uses a multi-factor ranking algorithm:

1. **Keyword Extraction** - NLP/LLM identifies product mentions in the message
2. **Product Matching** - Queries multiple affiliate partners (Amazon PA-API, Google Shopping)
3. **Ranking** - Scores candidates based on:
   - Relevance to the extracted keywords
   - Commission rates and payout potential
   - Historical conversion performance
   - Product availability and pricing

The highest-scoring result is returned as the winning ad.
