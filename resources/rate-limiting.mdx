description: "Questions about rate limits and quotas"

Understand ChatAds rate limits by plan tier, what happens when you exceed them, and how to implement graceful error handling with exponential backoff.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="What are the rate limits?">
Rate limits are per-team and shared across all API keys:

| Plan | Monthly Limit | Daily Limit |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Free | 100 requests | 10 requests |
| Starter | 5,000 requests | 500 requests |
| Pro | 50,000 requests | 5,000 requests |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

Limits reset at midnight UTC (daily) and the 1st of each month (monthly).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens when I hit a rate limit?">
You'll receive a `429` error with details:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "DAILY_QUOTA_EXCEEDED",
    "message": "Daily request limit exceeded.",
    "details": {
      "daily_limit": 100,
      "daily_usage": 101
    }
  }
}
```

The response includes a `Retry-After` header with seconds until reset.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I handle rate limit errors gracefully?">
Implement exponential backoff:

```typescript
async function analyzeWithRetry(message: string, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    const response = await client.analyzeMessage({ message });

    if (response.success) return response;

    if (response.error?.code === 'DAILY_QUOTA_EXCEEDED') {
      // Wait until tomorrow - don't retry
      throw new Error('Daily limit reached');
    }

    if (response.error?.code === 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED') {
      // Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s
      await sleep(1000 * Math.pow(2, i));
      continue;
    }

    throw new Error(response.error?.message);
  }
}
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are Amazon's API rate limits?">
Amazon's Product Advertising API has strict limits: 1 request per second initially. As you drive sales through affiliate links, this can increase to 10 requests per second. ChatAds handles this internally, but high-volume users should optimize their calls to avoid hitting these upstream limits.
