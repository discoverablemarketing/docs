Learn how ChatAds handles your data and best practices for keeping your API keys secure in production environments.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Is my data stored?">
ChatAds processes messages in real-time and does not store message content after processing. We retain:

- Usage logs (request counts, timestamps)
- Error logs (for debugging, anonymized)
- Team/account configuration

See our [Privacy Policy](https://getchatads.com/privacy) for details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How should I store my API key?">
Never expose your API key in client-side code. Best practices:

- Store in environment variables
- Use server-side API routes
- Rotate keys if exposed
- Use separate keys for dev/prod

```bash
# .env (never commit this file)
CHATADS_API_KEY=cak_your_api_key
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is ChatAds SOC 2 compliant?">
ChatAds is not currently SOC 2 certified. We follow security best practices including encrypted data transmission (TLS 1.3), secure API key storage, and minimal data retention.

For enterprise customers with specific compliance requirements, contact support@getchatads.com to discuss your needs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use ChatAds with HIPAA-covered applications?">
ChatAds is not HIPAA compliant and should not be used to process Protected Health Information (PHI). The API automatically strips PII from messages, but this doesn't meet HIPAA requirements.

If you're building healthcare applications, ensure ChatAds only receives non-PHI content or contact us about enterprise compliance options.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do you process or store end-user data?">
ChatAds processes message content in real-time to extract product keywords but does not store the original messages after processing. We retain:

- **Stored**: Usage counts, timestamps, error logs (anonymized), team configuration
- **Not stored**: Original message content, user identifiers, conversation history

Messages pass through our systems only for the duration of the API call. See our [Privacy Policy](https://getchatads.com/privacy) for complete details.
