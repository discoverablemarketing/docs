Control which traffic receives affiliate links. Learn how to set up geo-targeting, handle international users, and block specific keywords or product categories.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How do I set up geo-targeting?">
Pass the `country` parameter with an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code:

```json
{
  "message": "Best running shoes",
  "country": "US"
}
```

ChatAds uses this for:
- Localized affiliate links (amazon.com vs amazon.de)
- Country-specific product availability
- Geo-restriction enforcement (if configured)

You can also pass `ip` for automatic geo-detection.

**Recommendation:** ChatAds currently only matches US, English traffic. Passing `ip` or `country` lets you filter non-qualifying traffic before making API calls, saving your request quota and avoiding partner API throttling. If you already know the user's country, pass `country` directly; otherwise pass `ip` for auto-detection.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if I send non-US or non-English traffic?">
The API returns `success: true` but `matched: false` with a reason explaining why no ad was matched:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "matched": false,
  "reason": "non-US IP detected"
}
```

Common reasons include:
- `"non-US IP detected"` - Request originated from outside the United States
- `"non-English message"` - Message language detected as non-English

While these requests succeed (no error), they won't match ads and still count toward your rate limit. **Recommendation:** Filter non-qualifying traffic client-side before calling the API to maximize your quota efficiency.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I block certain keywords or products?">
Yes! Configure keyword rules in the dashboard:

1. Go to [app.getchatads.com/settings/rules](https://app.getchatads.com/settings/rules)
2. Add blocked keywords
3. Optionally set a custom rejection message

Blocked requests return `CONTENT_BLOCKED` (422) and don't count against your quota.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will ChatAds expand to other countries besides US?">
Currently, ChatAds only supports US affiliate partners (Amazon.com Associates). International expansion is on our roadmap, with UK and EU markets planned for future releases.

If you have specific country requirements, contact support@getchatads.com to discuss timeline and priorities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I target specific product categories?">
Not directly via API parameters, but you can influence results through:

1. **Message content** - More specific product queries yield more relevant matches
2. **Keyword rules** - Block unwanted categories using ignored/blocked keywords
3. **Intent filtering** - Use `min_intent` to filter low-quality matches

For category-specific affiliate programs or custom matching logic, contact support about enterprise options.
